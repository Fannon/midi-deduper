# MIDI Deduper

## Description

This [web app](https://fannon.github.io/midi-deduper/) allows you to de-duplicate accidental MIDI double triggers, as caused e.g. by some MIDI pad controllers.
It runs on any modern [Web MIDI enabled browser](https://caniuse.com/midi). 

Why did I create this project? I have a (finger) drum pad controller, which tends to produce accidental double triggers. 
This is actually not uncommon for pad controllers, especially when the sensitivity is increased / high. 

Such accidental double triggers may be annoying when recording, but will also especially cause problems when playing with [Melodics](https://melodics.com/) or similar software that scores you on correct playing.

## User Guide

First, you need to have a (virtual) MIDI Loop device, e.g. like [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) for Windows.

In the web app, choose your MIDI Input (the device you play) and then choose the MIDI loop device.
Don't forget to hit the "Save & Apply" button after you made changes.

### How the detection works

* A history of your played notes is kept (until a certain size)
* When a new note is incoming, the history is searched for recent notes
  * with the same note number
  * within the time threshold (configurable option)
  * below the velocity threshold (configurable option)
* If all of the above criteria apply, the note-on event is filtered out
* Note-off events are also filtered out, but by a simple "first-wins" approach (could be improved in the future)

## Developer Guide

* Requires a recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime
* Git clone this repository
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run build` (to copy over dependencies to webapp)
* Run `npm start`
